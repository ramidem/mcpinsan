# UNSHELF

A Library inventory management app.

## Getting Started (work in progress)

-   Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it as `.env` and setup database.
-   On your terminal, run `php artisan serve` and access `localhost:8000` to
    view the site on your browser. Optionally, you can pass `--port=PORT` to
    serve the site on a different port.

        php artisan serve --port=3000

-   run `composer install` to register an APP_KEY and install the dependencies
-   run `npm install && npm run dev` for the UI
-   run `php artisan migrate` to initialize the database
